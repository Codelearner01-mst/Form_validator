## 📋 How It Works

1. User fills out the form with name, email, and age.
2. JavaScript validates each field on submission.
3. If any field is invalid, an error message appears below it.
4. If all fields are valid, the form can be submitted or processed further.

## 🧪 Validation Rules

- **Name**: Must not be empty
- **Email**: Must follow standard email format
- **Age**: Must be a number and not empty

## 🎨 Design Notes

You can customize the background using either:
- A full-page image via `body { background-image: ... }`
- A frosted-glass effect using `backdrop-filter` on `.container`
